PatternCombination.java is main Running file.. It gets all object and calls classes from CountryInterface 
Country interface is implemented by CountryDAO java class. 
Country DAO class holds 4 methods .
1. to display all country list . country code , name ,continent ,surfacearea ,head of state
2. this method is to display country by its defined name .. client can enter name of country and class will provides detail .
3 .this method is similar as 2 nd method but it is works by code of country .
4. this method is to add country name .code , continent ,area and head of state.

this all continent is saved as enum .continent is permanent  location on earth .so enum is suitable for that ..


client class is in default package .. that runs seprate but as similar as main class works ...
